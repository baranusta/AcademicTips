Mostly they are same with the tips under research section.

# Additional Tips
- Negotiate about the requirements to complete the thesis. For example:
    - What kind of methods should be implemented
    - What kind of results are aimed to have
    - Is there any reqirement for publications?
    - Agree on it.
    - Write down.
- Plan a rough roadmap. 
    - This road map has to be planned as if the thesis will end before the actual deadline.
    - Nobody should believe that if the project ends early.. you can continue and add more... (actually this is not early end.. this is on TIME!!!)
    - If you want to add more.. plan it considering this as well. You should be strict and certain about it. Otherwise... you may modify the plan on the go a lot which can cause you and your supervisor adhere the plan less. It results in having stressfull couple of weeks when the deadline approaches.
    - Of course this is a research project and it is not something that you can meet your expectations always... Your plans has to take this into account as well.
- Stick to your roadmap!
- Do not fear to change your plans if it is unavoidable and do this after agreeing with everyone.
