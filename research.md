# Must Have's
- Arrange Weekly Meetings with Supervisor/Team.
- Aggree upon communication channels and way of interaction.
- Clearly determine the expectations.

# Meetings
- Keep diary
    - What are the topics
    - What are the new ideas to try
    - What are the decisions - todo's
    - Meaningful labeling is MUST for any topic.
        - In the future, you may wonder why you have decided to do this or that.
  
- Do not miss any. 
    - If there is no significant progress, then inform the attendants about:
        - What you have been doing
        - What you are going to do
        - When you expect to have some progress 
    - If you have to skip a meeting
        - inform everyone and try to reschedule.
        - If you can not reschedule, apply the points in previous one.
  
- Before the meeting
    - prepare a report as what you have done and send it(to update everyone and give the headlines to talk about of the meeting)
  
- After the meeting 
    - update the diary and send the respective part to everyone.
  
# What to focus while Reading
- What is the problem... :)
- What are the contributions
- What are the methods used
- Results
    - Weaknesses(might be spesific type of inputs?)
    - Strengths
    - What is the common way of showing the results and evaluating the performance of the contribution.


# Starting
- Before coding, read... read... read... until you have learnt the topics even if the 
    - supervisor has taught everything(which may be the case for some)
    - supervisor gave you the direction for implementation.
    - You need to understand why the problem is important and what are the existing approaches for general problem. 
    - The only part you may start besides reading is setting up the environment. reading input, writing output.
- If you believe you are ready to start implementation... 
    - Keep reading with only a little slower pace.
- Start keeping notes for related work part.
    - It should be thorough notes. You do not know which ones will be in which paper. You also do not know the spesific direction of the project.
    - Zotero or just excel sheet could be sufficient at this stage
  
# Development
- Keep reading.
- Split the development into tasks.
- Decide a task based on the data rather than intuition. 
    - For example. you believe a step is the bottleneck of the algorithm... What you need to do is to get the timings first.
- A task is not finished until you get all the meaningful results related to that task. 
    - This does not mean testing the algorithm well. Testing is another thing. 
    - Each result may change the direction of the project. Some other determined tasks may be decided to be unnecessary. So obtain the results first.
    - Writing the scripts for the results of this task development is part of that task development. 

- After each task is finished... 
    - write the method how you solve it. Later you may need to understand the algorithm. Write it when you already know every bit.
    - Try to figure out the ways of showing the results. Are you going to use tables? figures? Also make some comments on the results.
  
# IF You Get Stuck?
- well.. READ more!!
- do not get overwhelmed... it is in the nature.
- Do not afraid of asking for help from friends or colleagues.
- Your supervisor may want to challenge you more... It is fine!!!

# Writing the paper?
- If you believe come to that stage... You already written most of the related works, methods and results. completing the rest is not an issue? :)
    - Check the spelling mistakes(latex tools might help)
    - Check the grammer(use grammerly or word or.. there is lib said to be with latex. I did not checked.)
    - Check the captions of the figures, images, etc. They have to be self-contained and self-explanatory.
    - Check the referances for fig, table, chapter, section, subsection, etc. It might be referencing in wrong order!!!
    - Check the bibliograpy, Some info migh be missing for some refs(e.g. the published year, journal pages...)

- Check the format of the publication standarts
    - marjins...
    - ref style
    - spacing...
    - length...
    - some other restrictions??

Aim to finish the writing at most 3 weeks before the submission deadline including the reviews. Perhaps there will be changes for the texts or the results requested by someone...
